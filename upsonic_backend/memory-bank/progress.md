# Progress Log

## Current Status: MCP Execution Confirmed, Preparing for LLM Planning & Git

## 1. What Works / Completed
- Project Initialization & Dependencies (Corrected Directory).
- Memory Bank Setup (Corrected Directory).
- OpenRouter Test: Successful.
- Memory Test: Successful (`memory=True`).
- Basic FastAPI app (`main_orchestrator.py`) created.
- Port killing logic added.
- MCP tool loading from `mcp-config.json` implemented.
- Direct MCP Call Test: Successful execution of `filesystem` tool confirmed using `asyncio.to_thread`.

## 2. What's Next (LLM Planning & Setup)
1.  **Git Repository Setup:** Initialize repository, commit existing work, create remote repo via `gh`, push.
2.  **LLM Planning - Prompt Design:** Create a prompt for the agent to generate a structured MCP action plan from user input.
3.  **LLM Planning - API Integration:** Modify `/interact` to perform the planning call.
4.  **LLM Planning - Plan Parsing:** Add logic to parse the structured plan from the LLM response.
5.  **(Placeholder) Plan Execution:** Print the parsed plan steps.
6.  **Actual Plan Execution:** Implement logic to execute the sequence of MCP calls based on the plan (likely involving further `agent.do` calls with appropriate tool classes).
7.  **Upsonic Graph:** Refactor orchestration.
8.  **Knowledge Feature Investigation:** Research docs.
9.  **API Layer Enhancement:** Improve API.
10. **Advanced Features:** Add personalities, etc.

## 3. Known Issues
- Tool selection is currently placeholder/manual.
- Default agent memory didn't work without `memory=True`.

## 4. Evolution of Decisions
- Using dynamic class generation for MCP tools.
- Using `asyncio.to_thread` for blocking `agent.do` calls.
